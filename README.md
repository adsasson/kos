KSP kOS scripts

Project for automating KSP behaviors with kOS. 
Currently have:
  launch, comprised of ascent, and orbital insertion.
  manuever node execution.
  initial landing program, needs to be factored into descent (atmo vs no atmo) and touchdown.
  general libraries, need to be a bit better organized.
  
Goals:
  general improvement of current code.
  rendezvous, comprised of intercept, closing to target, and docking vs capture.
          intercept should try to calculate phasing orbit
  interplanetary maneuvers.
