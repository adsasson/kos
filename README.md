### KSP kOS scripts

Project for automating KSP behaviors with kOS, in the process of being heavily refactored.
Currently have:
  * launch, ascent, orbital orbital insertion
  * generic node execution
  * partial library of orbital mechanics calculations (e.g. vis viva, Keplerian equations).
  * some ship statistics calculations

Goals:
  * general improvement of current code.
  * rendezvous, comprised of intercept, closing to target, and docking vs capture.
      * intercept should try to calculate phasing orbit
  * interplanetary maneuvers.
  * test all the refactored stuff to see if it still works.
